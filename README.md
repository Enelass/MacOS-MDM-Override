# MacOS-MDM-Override

Scripts and methods to circumvent DNS, Proxy, Route, and PAC file restrictions on MacOS devices managed by MDM profiles. Includes DNS override using dnscrypt-proxy, proxy setting bypass, routing table modifications, and PAC file customizations.

## DISCLAIMER: EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY

This repository is provided strictly for **educational purposes only**. The techniques and scripts demonstrated here show how corporate network defenses might be circumvented, specifically to educate security professionals about potential vulnerabilities in MDM configurations.

Using these techniques without proper authorization may violate:
- Organizational security policies
- Employment agreements
- Acceptable use policies
- Applicable laws and regulations

Always obtain proper authorization before implementing any techniques described in this repository.

## How Organizations Can Protect Themselves

Organizations can implement the following security measures to protect against the techniques demonstrated in this repository:

### 1. Defense-in-Depth Approach

Implement multiple layers of security controls rather than relying on a single mechanism:
- Network-level filtering and monitoring
- Endpoint protection solutions
- Application whitelisting
- Regular security audits

### 2. Monitoring and Detection

- Monitor for unauthorized changes to system configuration files
- Implement file integrity monitoring on critical system files
- Monitor for unusual network traffic patterns
- Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions

### 3. Technical Controls

- Implement MAC (Mandatory Access Control) solutions
- Restrict system extension installations
- Use application control policies
- Deploy network extension frameworks
- Implement TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) profiles

### 4. Regular Security Assessments

- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Perform security configuration reviews
- Test MDM policy enforcement effectiveness
- Validate security controls through red team exercises

### 5. User Education and Policies

- Educate users about security policies and acceptable use
- Clearly document consequences of policy violations
- Implement need-to-know access controls
- Regularly review and update security policies

By understanding these potential evasion techniques, security professionals can better design and implement robust security controls that protect organizational assets while still enabling legitimate business activities.
